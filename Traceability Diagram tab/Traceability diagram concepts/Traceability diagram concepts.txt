<p>To work with traceability diagrams and diagram views, you have to understand the following concepts.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Concept</th><th>Description</th><th>Notes</th></tr><tr><td>Node</td><td><p>A term that is used in graph theory for an object.</p><p>In a DGC traceability diagram, a node is an asset or a complex relation.</p></td><td><ul><li>The node for an asset is depicted by a rectangle.</li><li>The node for a complex relation is depicted by a circle.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Edge</td><td><p>A term that is used in graph theory for a relation.</p><p>In a DGC traceability diagram, an edge is a directed relation.&nbsp;The word&nbsp;<em>directed</em>&nbsp;is added to indicate that the direction in which the relation is used is relevant for the diagram.</p></td><td><span>An edge is normally depicted by an arrow between two nodes.</span></td></tr><tr><td>Diagram view</td><td><p>A kind of query that determines which nodes and edges have to be displayed in a diagram for a given asset.</p><p>The diagram view also determines some aspects of the layout of the diagram: how the nodes and edges have to be displayed.</p></td><td>You can define multiple diagram views for the same asset type.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Diagram</td><td>The diagram that results from a selected diagram view, when applied to a given asset.</td><td><p>Example:</p><ac:image ac:width="301"><ri:attachment ri:filename="diagram-entire-screen.png"><ri:page ri:content-title="Traceability Diagram tab" /></ri:attachment></ac:image><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td>Flow</td><td>The entire course of nodes and relations from the start node to the end node.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1">Context</td><td colspan="1">A collection of nodes that does not belong in the flow.
