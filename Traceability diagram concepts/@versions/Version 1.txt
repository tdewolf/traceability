<p>To work with traceability diagrams and diagram views, you have to understand the following concepts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Node</em></strong>: A term that is used in graph theory for an object. <br />In a DGC traceability diagram, a node is an asset or a complex relation.<br />The node for an asset is depicted by a rectangle. The node for a complex relation is depicted by a circle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Edge</em>:</strong> A term that is used in graph theory for a relation.<br />In a DGC traceability diagram, an edge is a directed relation.&nbsp;The word <em style="line-height: 1.4285715;">directed</em> is added to indicate that the direction in which the relation is used, is relevant for the diagram.<br />In the diagram, an edge is normally depicted by an arrow between two nodes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Diagram view</em>:</strong> A kind of query that determines which nodes and edges have to be displayed in a diagram for a given asset. <br />The diagram view also determines some aspects of the layout of the diagram: how the nodes and edges have to be displayed.&nbsp;<br />You can define multiple diagram views for the same asset type. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Diagram</em>:</strong> The diagram that results from the selected diagram view, when applied to a given asset.<br /><span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">Below is an example of a traceability diagram:</span></p><p><ac:image ac:width="900"><ri:attachment ri:filename="diagram-entire-screen.png"><ri:page ri:content-title="Traceability Diagram tab" /></ri:attachment></ac:image></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Flow</em>:</strong>&nbsp;The entire course of nodes and relations from the start node to the end node.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Context</em>:</strong>&nbsp;A collection of nodes that does not belong in the flow. The nodes have an edge coming in from a flow node, however. Nodes can be context nodes if they represent a system, for example.</p><p><strong style="line-height: 1.4285715;"><em>Loop</em></strong><span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">: A diagram view that keeps looking for the same node type and edge type.</span></p><p><strong><em>Multi-step loop</em></strong>: A diagram view that keeps looking for the same node types and edge types.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
